## Overwiew
Stroke is a serious illness. It is a leading cause of death and disability. It would be nice if we can predict whether an individual is likely to have a stroke and thus prevent stroke in advance. 
This is a classfication problem. The target variable is 'stroke': 0 if the patient does not suffer from stroke and 1 if the patient does. 
In this project, I used Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classfier and Support Vector Classifier(SVC).
